# is_Even
This is an extension Samuel Miller's is_even code. I can't create a PR for reasons, so I made this.

Steps to use this:
1. make a folder, make a file in it name its index.js
2. run the exe file from the release(in the same directory) and it will write to the index.js file

NOTE: 
You can open the index.js file after its been written only with either vim or your browser, use anything else and it will stop responding.
